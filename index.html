<h1>Help!</h1>

<h2>The Beatles</h2>

<p>
Help, I need somebody,
</p>
<p>Help, not just anybody</p>
<p>Help, you know I need someone, help</p>
<p>When I was younger, so much younger than today</p>
<p>I never needed anybody's help in any way</p>
<p>But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured</p>
<p>Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors</p>
<p>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down</p>
<p>And I do appreciate you being round</p>
<p>Help me get my feet back on the ground</p>
<p>Won't you please, please help me</p>
<p>And now my life has changed in oh so many ways</p>
<p>My independence seems to vanish in the haze</p>
<p>But every now and then I feel so insecure</p>
<p>I know that I just need you like I've never done before</p>
<p>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down</p>
<p>And I do appreciate you being round</p>
<p>Help me get my feet back on the ground</p>
<p>Won't you please, please help me!</p>
